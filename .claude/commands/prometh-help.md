# Prometh Context Framework - Help & Command Reference

## 🔥 Prometh Context Framework
*Just as Prometheus gave humanity fire, this framework gives AI users the tools to ignite high-quality, predictable output.*

The Prometh Context Framework provides structured documentation workflows for strategic planning (PRDs) and implementation specifications (SPECs) with integrated project tracking.

---

## Directory Structure Variants

The framework supports two directory structures:

**Committed Documentation** (Team Projects):
- `prometh-docs/` - Documentation tracked in git and shared with team
- `PROMETH.md` - Tracking file tracked in git

**Local-Only Documentation** (Personal Projects):
- `prometh-docs.local/` - Documentation stays local, not committed
- `PROMETH.local.md` - Tracking file stays local, not committed

**Priority**: If both exist, `.local` variants take precedence and non-local versions are ignored.

---

## Available Slash Commands

All slash commands require PROMETH.md or PROMETH.local.md in project root. Use `/prometh-init` if missing.

### Framework Setup

#### `/prometh-init`
**Purpose**: Initialize Prometh Context Framework in any project
**Prerequisites**: Requires existing CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md (created via `/init`)
**Usage**: `/prometh-init`

**What it does:**
- Prompts you to choose committed or local-only documentation structure
- Creates `prometh-docs/prds/` and `prometh-docs/specs/` (or `.local` variants)
- Initializes PROMETH.md or PROMETH.local.md tracking file for document inventory
- Sets up project-wide documentation workflow
- Provides context-aware guidance based on project state

---

### Implementation Execution

#### `/prometh-build`
**Purpose**: Execute SPEC implementation with 3-phase workflow tracking  
**Input**: SPEC file path (required)  
**Usage**: `/prometh-build prometh-docs/specs/user-authentication-spec.md` (or `prometh-docs.local/specs/...`)

**3-Phase Execution:**
- **Phase 1: Planning** - Interactive task completion for requirements analysis and technical design
- **Phase 2: Task Breakdown** - Detailed development tasks and dependency mapping  
- **Phase 3: Implementation** - Core development, testing, and deployment validation

**Features:**
- Interactive progress tracking with task completion
- Tracking file status updates (Draft → Planning → Implementation → Completed)
- Phase transition validation and milestone tracking
- Resume sessions from last checkpoint
- Complete traceability back to original PRD

**Output**: Guided implementation workflow with comprehensive progress tracking

---

### Project Status & Tracking

#### `/prometh-status`
**Purpose**: Display comprehensive project documentation dashboard  
**Usage**:
- `/prometh-status` - Full status dashboard
- `/prometh-status --brief` - Condensed view
- `/prometh-status --counts` - Document counts only
- `/prometh-status --health` - Health metrics and suggestions

**Dashboard Features:**
- Document inventory summary (PRDs, SPECs, documentation)
- Recent activity feed with chronological updates
- Traceability matrix showing PRD → SPEC relationships
- Health metrics and context-aware next step suggestions

## Workflow Examples

### 1. Strategic Initiative → Implementation
```
# 1. Create strategic PRD (say this in conversation)
"Create a PRD for our mobile platform for customer self-service"
→ prometh-prd skill creates: prometh-docs/prds/PRD-20260223-mobile-platform.md

# 2. Generate implementation SPEC from PRD (say this in conversation)
"Derive a SPEC from prometh-docs/prds/PRD-20260223-mobile-platform.md"
→ prometh-spec skill creates: prometh-docs/specs/SPC-20260223-mobile-platform.md

# 3. Check project status (slash command)
/prometh-status
```

### 2. Bug Report → SPEC
```
# Convert bug report to implementation SPEC (say this in conversation)
"Convert critical-payment-bug.pdf into a SPEC"
→ prometh-spec skill creates SPEC

# Generate project documentation (say this in conversation)
"Generate a README for this project"
→ prometh-doc skill creates README.md
```

### 3. Document Normalization
```
# Normalize existing strategic document (say this in conversation)
"Normalize quarterly-planning-deck.pdf into a PRD"
→ prometh-prd skill normalizes into PRD format

# Normalize existing user story (say this in conversation)
"Convert existing-user-story.md into a SPEC"
→ prometh-spec skill normalizes into SPEC format
```

### 4. Complete Implementation Workflow
```
# 1. Create strategic PRD (say this in conversation)

## Best Practices

### When to Use PRDs
- Strategic initiatives requiring business justification
- Cross-functional projects needing stakeholder alignment  
- Market-driven feature development
- Complex technical decisions with business impact

### When to Use SPECs
- Feature implementation and development tasks
- Bug fixes and system enhancements
- Technical debt and refactoring projects
- User stories requiring detailed implementation

### Document Lifecycle
1. **PRD Creation** → Strategic planning and stakeholder alignment (`prometh-prd` skill — invoked naturally)
2. **SPEC Generation** → Implementation planning from PRDs (`prometh-spec` skill — invoked naturally)
3. **Guided Implementation** → Execute SPEC phases with tracking (`/prometh-build` slash command)
4. **Documentation** → Generate README/runbooks as needed (`prometh-doc` skill — invoked naturally)
5. **Status Tracking** → Monitor progress via `/prometh-status` slash command

### Complete Implementation Flow
```
Strategic Vision (PRD) → Implementation Plan (SPEC) → Guided Execution (BUILD) → Delivery
       ↓                        ↓                            ↓                       ↓
  prometh-prd skill        prometh-spec skill          /prometh-build            Completed
  (conversation)           (conversation)              (slash command)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **CLAUDE.md missing**: Run `/init` to create project configuration
- **Tracking file missing**: Run `/prometh-init` to initialize framework
- **Wrong document type**: Framework auto-detects and suggests correct command
- **File access errors**: Check file permissions and paths

### Getting Help
- Use `/prometh-help` for this reference
- Check tracking file (PROMETH.md or PROMETH.local.md) for project-specific guidance
- View `/prometh-status` for context-aware next steps
